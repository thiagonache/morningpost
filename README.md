# The Morning Post

It's nice to have something interesting to read with your morning coffee. My task with this project is to write a Go program that will curate a little “morning newspaper” for you.

## Getting started

### Running program

_If_ you have `Go` installed and configured on your machine, you can `run` it:

```bash
$ go run github.com/thiagonache/morningpost/cmd/morningpost@latest
go: downloading github.com/thiagonache/morningpost v0.0.9-alpha
Listening at http://127.0.0.1:33000
```

Alternatively, you can `download` the compiled binary from the [releases](https://github.com/thiagonache/morningpost/releases) page.
